Project Name: Sneaker Closet Manager
Project Description
Sneaker Closet Manager is a Java-based application that allows users to catalog, organize, and manage their sneaker collection. Built using object-oriented programming principles and SQLite database integration, the application supports full CRUD functionality, sneaker style profiling, and a modular designed for future expansion (GUI or web interface).

Project Tasks
Task 1: Initial Project Setup
- Create project structure and base classes
- Set up Git/GitHub repository
- Establish development environment (JDK, IDE, SQLite driver)

Task 2: Design Phase (Week 1)
- Define core classes (Sneaker, SneakerManager..)
- Identify OOP principles: inheritance, composition, interface usage
- Document class responsibilities

Task 3: Implement OOP Structure (Week 2)
- Create Sneaker class
- Add StyleProfile composition
- Implement Displayable interface
- Build SneakerManager for menu logic and user input handling

Task 4: Add Database Integration (Week 3 & 4)
- Connect Java to SQLite using JDBC
- Implement SneakerStorage class
- Add CRUD operations
- Create tables automatically via SQL
- Refactor SneakerManager to use DB instead of in-memory list

Task 5: Improve Application Logic
- Add input validation
- Implement update sneaker workflow
- Add error handling and DB guards
- Prepare for GUI phase

Task 6: Testing
- Populate test sneakers
- Verify CRUD operations
- Validate update logic
- Debug runtime issues

Task 7: Documentation
- Create README
- Update phase descriptions
- Prepare class documentation
- Object-oriented design (classes, objects, composition, interfaces)
- Java fundamentals and console app architecture
- JDBC database connectivity
- SQL CRUD operations
- Exception handling and debugging
- Version control with Git/GitHub
Languages & Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 17+)
- SQLite
- JDBC
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code / IntelliJ 
Development Process
Iterative/Agile-inspired workflow focused on incremental development, testing, and refactoring across phases.
How to Run the Project
Prerequisites:
- Java JDK installed
- SQLite JDBC driver in project folder
- All .java files compiled


Notes
- SQLite DB file is created automatically.
- Ensure JDBC driver is included in classpath.
- Future versions may introduce a GUI layer.
